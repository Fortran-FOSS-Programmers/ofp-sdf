R402:  type-spec is intrinsic-type-spec or derived-type-spec
R404:  intrinsic-type-spec is INTEGER    or ...
R457:  derived-type-spec   is type-name  or ...

R468:  ac-spec  is type-spec ::  or ...

ac-spec (for example)

      A = [INTEGER :: ]

 is ambiguous syntactically because type-name could be INTEGER
